# [Design a machine learning model training solution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/design-machine-learning-model-training-solution/)

# Introduction

Learn how to design an end-to-end machine learning solution using **Microsoft Azure** in 6 steps:

1. **Define the Problem**
2. **Get the Data**
3. **Prepare the Data**
4. **Train the Model**
5. **Deploy the Model**
6. **Monitor the Model**

---

# Define the Problem

To define the problem, focus on answering these three questions:

1. **What is the expected output?**
2. **Which machine learning task are we tackling?**
3. **What criteria make the model successful?**

---

## Machine Learning Tasks

Based on the data and expected output, the problem can fall into:

* **Regression**
* **Classification**
* **Time Series Forecasting**
* **NLP**
* **Computer Vision**

---

## Steps to Approach the Problem

1. Load the data.
2. Process the data.
3. Split the data.
4. Choose the model.
5. Train the model.
6. Score the model (make predictions).
7. Evaluate the model.

---

### Iterative Process

This process is  **iterative** : repeat steps until the model meets the success criteria.

# Get and Prepare Data

To train a model, focus on both **data quantity** and  **data quality** â€”both are essential for better results.

1. **Define the Data Source and Format**
   * Identify where the data is stored (e.g., database, CRM, or IoT device).
   * Understand the data format (structured, semi-structured, or unstructured).
2. **Serve the Data**
   * Store the data in a cloud data service for accessibility during training.
   * Best practice: Use separate tools for data storage and model training to ensure flexibility and reduce costs.
3. **Design a Data Ingestion Solution**
   * Extract data from the source, transform it, and load it into a serving layer (ETL).
4. **Create a Data Ingestion Pipeline**
   * A pipeline is a sequence of tasks to move and transform data.
   * Use tools like:
     * **Azure Synapse Analytics**
     * **Azure Databricks**
     * **Azure Machine Learning**
     * 

# Train the Model

The choice of service for training machine learning models depends on factors like:

* **Type of model** you need to train.
* **Level of control** required during training.
* **Time investment** you're willing to make.
* Existing  **services in your organization** .
* Preferred  **programming language** .

## Available Services for Training

* **Azure Machine Learning**
* **Azure Databricks**
* **Microsoft Fabric**
* **Azure AI Services** : Prebuilt models (APIs) for quick and customizable solutions to save time and effort.

### When to Use Each Service:

* Use **Microsoft Fabric** or **Azure Databricks** if you want to:
  * Keep **data analytics, engineering, and science** within the same service.
  * Utilize **distributed compute** for large datasets (e.g., with PySpark).
* Use **Azure Machine Learning** or **Azure Databricks** for **full control** over model training and management.
* Use **Azure Machine Learning** when:
  * **Python** is your preferred language.
  * You want an **intuitive user interface** for managing the machine learning lifecycle.

## Decide Between Compute Options

* **CPU vs. GPU** : GPUs are preferred for deep learning or large-scale computations.
* **General Purpose vs. Memory-Optimized** : Depends on the nature of the workload.
  general purpose : balanced cpu to memory ratio for test and small dataset, Memory-Optimized for memory-to-CPU ratio.
* **Spark Clusters** : For distributed computing on large datasets.

 **Tip** : Monitor compute utilization during training to optimize resource usage and scale as needed.

# Integrate a model

how to integaret the model affects to traint he model and whic data to use

integrating the model is to deploy it in an endpoint to make

real time predcictions (if you want to score (predict) each new data as it comes in)

or

batch predictions

To decide whether to design a real-time or batch deployment solution, you need to consider the following questions:

* How often should predictions be generated?
* How soon are the results needed?
* Should predictions be generated individually or in batches?
* How much compute power is needed to execute the model?

in real time prediction the resources should always be active and return the results almost immediatly
we can use services like **azure container instance or azure kubernet services** they provide a lightweight infrastructure for your deployed model, but the compute will be always on you can't pause, or stop the compute as the model must always be available for immediate predictions.

Alternatively, if you need  **batch predictions** , you need compute that can handle a large workload. Ideally, you'd use a **compute cluster** that can score the data in *parallel* batches by using multiple nodes. and because the nodes are activated only when the batch scoring is trigered you can save significant costs.

# Monitor the Model

Deploying the model is not the end; as a data scientist, you need to monitor its **performance** and **retrain it with new data** when necessary.

## Operationalizing a Model

Once trained, the model needs to be prepared for enterprise-scale by following these steps:

1. Convert model training into a  **robust and reproducible pipeline** .
2. Test the code and model in a **development** environment.
3. Deploy the model in a **production** environment.
4. **Automate** the entire process.

## Collaborative Approach to MLOps

To scale and operationalize the model, teams collaborate as follows:

* **Data engineers** : Manage data storage in Azure Blob Storage.
* **Infrastructure teams** : Create and manage Azure resources (e.g., Azure Machine Learning workspace).
* **Data scientists** : Focus on developing and training the model (inner loop).
* **Machine learning engineers** : Handle model deployment (outer loop).

### MLOps Architecture Steps

1. **Setup** : Create required Azure resources.
2. **Model development (Inner Loop)** : Explore, process data, and train/evaluate the model.
3. **Continuous Integration** : Package and register the model.
4. **Model Deployment (Outer Loop)** : Deploy the trained model.
5. **Continuous Deployment** : Test the model and promote it to production.
6. **Monitoring** : Track model and endpoint performance.

## Monitoring the Model

Monitoring includes:

* **Performance tracking** : Assess model accuracy and efficiency over time.
* **Data drift detection** : Identify changes in the statistical properties of the input data.
* **Concept drift detection** : Detect shifts in the relationship between input and output variables.

### Retraining the Model

Retraining can occur:

* **On a schedule** .
* **Based on performance metrics** (e.g., drop in accuracy).

### Preparing and Automating Code

1. **Script-based Training** : Use scripts instead of notebooks for easier automation.
2. **Centralized Repository** : Store code in a version-controlled repository.
3. **Automation** : Use Azure tools to automate scripts based on triggers or external events.

## Tools for Automation

* **Azure DevOps** and  **GitHub Actions** : Ideal for creating automation pipelines and triggering Azure Machine Learning workflows.
* **Azure CLI** : Preferred over SDK for better integration with DevOps and GitHub to manage jobs and resources.
